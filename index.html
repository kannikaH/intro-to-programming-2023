        <h1>About</h1>
        <img src="IamACat.gif" alt="I am a cat.">
        <p style="width: 100%;">My name is <strong>Kannika Henderson</strong>, As a dedicated mother of two wonderful children,
        I took a deliberate pause from my career to provide the best care for my family.
        During my career break, I remained deeply committed to staying updated with industry trends. 
        I honed my technical skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL Server,
        and Data Analytics, through online courses and personal projects,
        ensuring that I am well-prepared to rejoin the workforce with confidence.
